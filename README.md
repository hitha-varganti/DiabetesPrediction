# DiabetesPrediction
- Developed a machine learning Linear Regression model for prediction of diabetes patient hospital stay duration using Python, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn based on lab procedures, number of medications, glucose tests, and A1C tests data

- Conducted statistical analysis, creating visualizations (heatmaps, violin/scatter/line plots) to uncover key trends

- Minimized overfitting with cross validation and regularization, RMSE by 50% to increase model accuracy
